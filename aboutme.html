		<h3>Hello. Welcome to my page! I &#39;m Ghela Mae D. Villafuerte. I &#39;m 20 years old and currently taking up Bachelor of Science in Business Administration Major in Marketing Management at Far Eastern University Makati. My goal is to be a successful marketer, to inspire souls, to lead the youth and encourage people to be the best version of themselves. My greatest dream is to be a speaker who would share not only words of wisdom but also my advocacies, cherished moments and life lessons. I hope 10 years from now, I &#39;d be releasing my own book about my experiences as I walk through my journey of seeing the real world, meeting new people, establishing strong bond of connections and how I find myself in this field. I told myself once, &#34;I &#39;ll be a game changer &#34; and from that point, it will be me, my very own brand and my always.</h3>
